# Citi Bike Analysis
Utilized 08-2019 Citi Bike Data
Intended to use August data across multiple years, but settled for one at the rate at which the program took to run just the first year.

## Phenomenon Focuses
- Gender and location
- Age and duration

### Gender
My primary focus was to analyze the numbers of female count reports at different locations to see if there was any significance to the numbers themselves or the focus on particular locations. 

### Age
Using birth year, I sketched through a number of statistics using the trip duration. We can generate a lot of easy to observe plots with age as a (line) graphing base. 

## Weird data
There's probably something moderately incorrect about the year 1969 in the data. I intended to do some digging in the actual data about the outliers, but there nearly seems to just be some a lot of data points, not necessarily bogus or copied data.
